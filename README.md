ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @S4-Okapi

ðŸ‘€ I want to play settler IV with WIN 10. I managed to install the game in high resolution and good graphics.
BUT - when I installed the editor using the editor fix from @elishacloud (Elisha Riedlinger), it was only possible 
in English. Is there a way to set the fix so that the editor runs in German again? Or how can I contact Elisha?
